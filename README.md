# AI-to-BS
Substitute certain overhyped programming terms, such as "Deep Learning", and "Machine Learning", and "Artificial Intelligence" with more accurate replacements such as "Linear Algebra", "IF Statements", and "BS That Doesn't Exist Yet"

Inspired by and adapted from the infamous [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) extension by panicsteve, as originally released under the WTFPL.
